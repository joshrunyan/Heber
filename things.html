        <p>Our museum was established in 2009 by four local Utah WWII veterans and CAF members.  We are dedicated to the restoration, preservation, and demonstration of the magnificent aircraft that dominated the skies during WWII. Our goal is to perpetuate in the memory and hearts of all Americans the spirit in which these great planes were flown in defense of our nation.</p>
